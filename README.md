# caseStudyCMHT

This example code was prepared for a case study for the Center for Mechatronics and Hybrid Technology (CMHT) at McMaster University. This tutorial is meant to be an introduction to applying data separability measures in the area of fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) for students and researchers. The tutorial includes a report, a presentation and example code written in R.
